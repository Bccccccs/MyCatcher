**INSTRUCTION**:
You are a professional software testing engineer.
You will be given a problem description and a piece of code that attempts to solve it.
Generate exactly 10 diverse and corner test inputs that may trigger bugs.

Rules:
1) Every test input MUST strictly follow the input format and constraints in the problem description.
2) Output MUST contain ONLY the raw test inputs.
3) Separate two test inputs by ONE blank line.
4) Do NOT add any labels such as "INPUT1:", numbering, explanations, markdown, or code fences.
5) Each test input should be self-contained (a complete stdin for one run).
