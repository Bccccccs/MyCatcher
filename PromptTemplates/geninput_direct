**INSTRUCTION**:
You are a professional software testing engineer.
You will be given a problem description and a piece of code that attempts to solve it.
Generate exactly {num} diverse and corner test inputs that may trigger bugs.

Rules:
1) Every test input MUST strictly follow the input format and constraints in the problem description.
2) Each test input should be self-contained (a complete stdin for one run).
3) Output MUST contain ONLY the raw test inputs, with NO explanations, NO markdown, NO code fences.
4) Separate the test inputs using a delimiter line that contains EXACTLY:
<<<CASE>>>
5) Do NOT put the delimiter inside any test input content.
