Problem Description
You are given two integer arrays A and B, and a non-negative integer k.
Your task is to compute the maximum number of pairs that can be formed between elements of A and B, subject to the following rule:
	•	An element A[i] can be paired with an element B[j] if and only if
|A[i] − B[j]| ≤ k.

Each element in A and B can be used in at most one pair.

Input Format
	•	The first line contains three integers n, m, and k, where:
	•	n is the length of array A,
	•	m is the length of array B,
	•	k is the maximum allowed absolute difference.
	•	The second line contains n integers representing array A.
	•	The third line contains m integers representing array B.

Output Format

Output a single integer — the maximum number of valid pairs that can be formed.

Constraints
	•	1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 × 10⁵
	•	0 ≤ k ≤ 10⁹
	•	−10⁹ ≤ A[i], B[j] ≤ 10⁹
